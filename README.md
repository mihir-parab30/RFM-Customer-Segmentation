## 📌 Abstract

In this analysis, 500,000+ online retail transactions were examined to classify customers based on their purchase behavior. By calculating RFM scores and applying clustering algorithms, distinct customer groups were identified. This segmentation helps businesses allocate resources efficiently and improve customer retention through targeted strategies.
